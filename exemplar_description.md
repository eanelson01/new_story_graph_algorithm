| purity               | A binary classification of pure or impure based on if more than half of the news articles in the connected component are related to the tracked story.                                                         | 
| degree_category      | A description of how popular that news story was based on the degree of the exemplar connected component. Connected components are labeled low for degrees less than 7.5 and high for degrees greater than 7.5. | 
| degree_value         | The degree of the story's connected component at its peak.                                                                                                                                                     |

| story_end_time       | The end time for the story pulled from the time and date found in the URI for the last graph of the story.                                                                                                     |
| links                | A list of dictionaries that each represent graphs that makes up the story in chronological order.                                                                                                              |
| graph_link           | The link to the individual graph on the story graph website.                                                                                                                                                   | 
| cc_degree            | The degree of the connected component related to the given story found in the individual graph.                                                                                                                |
| cc_index  | The index of the selected connected component. Indices start at 1 in this exemplar dataset to match the output on the story graph website.                                                                     |
